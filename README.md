`{standard}` provides a simplified interface for fitting and using
standard curves in R for work in biochemistry and molecular biology.
Many assays conducted in laboratory environments require the creation of
standard curves from known samples to then calculate the concentrations
of unkown samples.

The workflow usually includes the fitting of a model (usually linear) to
a set of readings (in the example below, absorbance @ 660 nm) from
samples of known concentrations, extracting an equation from the model
in the format `y = mx + c` and using this formula to calculate the
unkown values.

This task can be conducted in Microsoft Excel, other spreadsheet
programs, and various software packages that come with some plate
readers and other pieces of laboratory equipment.

These approaches however don’t allow for automation of processing, or
reproducibility and transparency of experiments.

Many wet-lab scientists would like to use the R programming language
more in their work, including for the task of fitting and using standard
curves. The model-fitting cababiliies and interface in R is enourmous
however, and can often be overwhelming and not straight forward, when
all a user needs to do is fit one model, and do some calculations with
the fitted model. This is where `{standard}` comes in.

In `{standard}` we have reduced the process down to two main functions.

1.  `std_curve_fit()` which takes the data from the known samples and
    fits a standard curve.
2.  `std_curve_calc()` which takes a standard curve a values from unkown
    samples, and calculates the concentrations of the unkowns based on
    the standard curve.

With these functions, the use of standard curves for molecular biology
work in R can be streamlined, and importantly can remain repropducible
and transparent.

## Installation

Currently no published on CRAN, but install from GitHub with the
following:

``` r
install.packages("standard", repo = "https://bradyajohnston.r-universe.dev")
```

## Example

In the example below, we have the results of a Bradford assay, with
known protein concentrations of our standards, and their corresponding
`A660 nm` readings. See XXthis vignette on how to read these values in
from an excel file or a `.csv` file. In this example we are just going
to manually write in the values in the code.

Below we are doing the following:

1.  Creating vectors of the `prot` concentrations & `abs`
    concentrations.
2.  Combining them both into a `data.frame` called `assay_data`
3.  Fitting a standard curve with `std_curve_fit()`
4.  Using the standard curve to calculate the unknowns with
    `std_curve_calc()`
5.  Plotting the final results with `plot()`.

``` r
library(standard)

# Protein concentrations of the standards used in the assay
prot <- c(0.000, 0.016, 0.031, 0.063, 0.125, 0.250, 0.500, 1.000, 
          0.000, 0.016, 0.031, 0.063, 0.125, 0.250, 0.500, 1.000) 

# absorbance readins from the standards used in the assay
abs <- c(0.329, 0.352, 0.349, 0.379, 0.417, 0.491, 0.668, 0.956, 
         0.327, 0.341, 0.355, 0.383, 0.417, 0.446, 0.655, 0.905)

assay_data <- data.frame(
  Protein = prot, 
  Absorbance = abs
)
head(assay_data)
    Protein Absorbance

  5   0.125      0.417
  6   0.250      0.491
```

``` r
our_std_curve <- std_curve_fit(
  data = assay_data, 
  conc = Protein, 
  resp = Absorbance
  )

We can see that internally, R has fitted a linear model to the data, and
has printed a range of summary statistics. While these are useful for
more complex modelling, we are mostly concerned with the R<sup>2</sup>
value, to tell how linear our standards are, and what the final equation
is for calculating protein concentrations from the absorbance readings
of unknown samples.

We can use the base `plot()` function to plot the standard curve with
relevant information included on the plot.

``` r
plot(our_std_curve)
```

With the formula now known, you can either use this formula to manually
calculate your protein concentrations from their absorbance values, or
use the `std_curve_calc()` function which will take a `standard curve`
from `std_curve_fit()` and a numeric vector of observtations (in this
case the absorbance readings), and return a data frame of the calculated
values for you.

``` r
unk <- c(0.554, 0.568, 0.705)

calc_unk <- std_curve_calc(
  std_curve = our_std_curve, 
  unknowns = unk
  )

calc_unk
  # A tibble: 3 × 2
    Absorbance Protein
         <dbl>   <dbl>
  1      0.554   0.361
  2      0.568   0.384
  3      0.705   0.609
```

You can even just use the `plot()` function on the output from
`std_curve_calc()` to plot the calculated values onto your standard
curve.

``` r
plot(calc_unk)
```
